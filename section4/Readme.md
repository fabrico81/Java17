We're talking about logical operators in this section. Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. They are typically used in conditional statements to determine if a condition is true or false. There are three logical operators: AND, OR, and NOT. The AND operator returns true if both conditions are true. The OR operator returns true if either condition is true. The NOT operator returns true if the condition is false. In this section, we'll learn about the different types of logical operators and how to use them.
