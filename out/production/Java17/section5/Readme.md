We're talking about Expressions and Operators in this section. Expressions are the most basic building blocks of any program. They are how we communicate with the computer. Expressions are made up of Operators and Operands. Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result. Operands are the values that operators act on. For example, in the expression 1 + 2, the plus sign (+) is the operator and 1 and 2 are the operands. The result of this expression is 3. In this section, we'll learn about the different types of operators and how to use them.
